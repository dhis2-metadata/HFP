# HFP - Health Facility Profile {#hfp-design}

## Introduction

The Health Facility Profile (HFP) toolkit focuses on implementing integrated, people-centred health facility profiles, providing a comprehensive overview of main healthcare facility's resources, services, and performance indicators.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes the importance of monitoring trends and evaluating progress in healthcare facility management by collecting relevant data through national health information systems. Routine data collected from health facilities, as facilitated by the Health Facility Profile toolkit, offer insights into service utilisation, availability, quality, and coverage. This information empowers healthcare managers for planning resource allocation, identifying bottlenecks in service delivery and responding to public health emergencies.

Unlike quality assurance assessment data, health facility profiles can be routinely reported from the facility or district without undergoing strict protocols for verification and observation for the purpose of routine monitoring and analysis. 

This system design document for the Health Facility Profile toolkit will outline the key components and features of the toolkit, providing a comprehensive overview of its functionality. While we aim to present a detailed configuration of the toolkit's data elements and workflows, please note that this document does not consider the resources and infrastructure needed to implement such a system, such as servers, power, internet connections, backups, training and user support, which can be found in the [DHIS2 Tracker Implementation Guide](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/implement/tracker-implementation/target-audience.html

In the following sections of this document, we will delve into the specifics of the Health Facility Profile toolkit, including its data capture methods, analysis capabilities, and its role in strengthening healthcare facility management within health systems.

### Acknowledgements

The HFP toolkit for DHIS2 was designed with support from The Global Fund in collaboration with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance with technical inputs provided by WHO Division of Data, Analytics and Delivery for Impact (DDI). Reviews with Global Fund M&E staff were conducted to find synergies with RSSH M&E Framework & KPIs, C-19 RM M&E framework and gather other partner input. Country learning and field experiences were generously shared by partners at MOH Uganda, HISP Uganda, MOH Lao PDR and HISP Vietnam.
